This project aims to cluster a set of bio-sequences from SARS-CoV-2 viruses using density-based
clustering with the Levenshtein distance metric. The Levenshtein distance is a method for
comparing two strings and can be used to classify biological sequences. A method known as
density-based clustering locates clusters in datasets by locating regions with large concentrations
of data points. By applying density-based clustering with the Levenshtein distance, this project
seeks to group similar bio-sequences together and identify potential relationships between
different strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This approach has potential applications in
understanding the evolution and spread of the virus, as well as aiding in the development of
vaccines and treatments.
